The analysis makes sense for the time in which I collected the data. Most of the top data is skiers, snowboarders, people who won gold for the olympics recently. The only thing that was suprising was how big the difference was between the highest searched thing on wikipedia to the second highest searched thing on wikipedia. I think what was interesting was how much raw data is there for the taking if someone is able to code just a little bit.
